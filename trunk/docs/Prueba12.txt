Taringa! is a virtual community from Argentina created in 2004 by Fernando Sanz, then acquired in November 2006 by Alberto Nakayama and the Botbol brothers. On Taringa!, users can share all kinds of information through posts. This site is a Web 2.0 website. Taringa has become one of the largest online communities in both Argentina and Latin America during the last 8 years. On Taringa!, registered users can share information such as funny photos, web memes, and breaking news in the form of posts. Sharing done on Taringa is carried out through a collaborative system of interactive content, while users try to gain recognition from the community and contribute to its "Collective Intelligence" (the website's motto).

Taringa! does not allow the publication of sexually explicit material as a new site -called Poringa!- was created. In Poringa! users can publish this sort of explicit content. While Poringa! is a completely separate site, its users and moderators are the same as in Taringa!.
